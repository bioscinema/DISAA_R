\title{DISAA: MZINB Model for Analyzing Count Data}
\usage{
disaa(counts, covariates, max_iter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A matrix of count data (n x m) with rows representing samples and columns representing features.}

\item{covariates}{A matrix of covariates for the samples (n x p).}

\item{max_iter}{The maximum number of iterations for the EM algorithm (default is 100).}
}
\value{
A list containing optimized values for \code{pi}, \code{theta}, \code{eta}, \code{beta}, \code{mu}, and computed \code{p-values} for the model.
}
\description{
The \code{disaa} function is a wrapper function that implements the MZINB model for analyzing count data.
It uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to iteratively optimize the parameters. This function
is ideal for count data, particularly with a high prevalence of zero counts.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming `counts` is an n x m count matrix and `covariates` is an n x p covariate matrix
# result <- disaa(counts, covariates)
}
